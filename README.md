## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am currently working as a Junior Full Stack Developer and UI designer.

### In short:
* I am working mostly in: React - Redux, Material UI, PHP - MVC frontend for static sites, Slim+Eloquent as a backend, MySQL, and usual HTML, SCSS and JS.
* Although my favourite Stack is: Typescript, React, Redux, styled-components, NodeJS with NestJS, GatsbyJS.
* Big fan of: GraphQL, Docker, mentioned above stack ^^
* I expand my knowledge about: Docker, dev-ops stuff (Linux, Nginx), and all the mentioned stack above.
