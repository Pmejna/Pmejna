## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Przemyslaw Mejna, currently working as a Junior Full Stack Developer and UI designer.

### In short:
* I am working mostly in: React - Redux, Material UI, PHP - MVC frontend for static sites, Slim+Eloquent as a backend, MySQL, and usual HTML, SCSS and JS.
* Although my favourite Stack is: Typescript, React, Redux, styled-components, NodeJS with NestJS, GatsbyJS
* I expand my knowledge about: Docker, dev-ops stuff (Linux, Nginx), and all the mentioned stack above 

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
A full-stack generative art application written in React/Typescript as a frontend and NodeJS/Nestjs backend. 
You might see an upcoming demo and Storybook custom components documentation relative to it in a couple of months.

### My portfolio website
New updates coming soon as the website has been buildt while ago: so time to refactor some code, add new projects and implement missing features.
